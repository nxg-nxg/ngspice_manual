        <p>
            Ngspice is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for nonlinear and linear
            analyses. Circuits may contain resistors, capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors,
            independent or dependent voltage and current sources, loss-less and lossy transmission
            lines, switches, uniform distributed RC lines, and the five most common semiconductor
            devices: diodes, BJTs, JFETs, MESFETs, and MOSFETs.
        </p>
        <p>Some introductory remarks on how to use ngspice may be found in Chapt. 21.</p>
        <p>
            Ngspice is an update of Spice3f5, the last Berkeley's release of Spice3 simulator
            family. Ngspice is being developed to include new features to existing Spice3f5 and to
            fix its bugs. Improving a complex software like a circuit simulator is a very hard task
            and, while some improvements have been made, most of the work has been done on bug
            fixing and code refactoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ngspice has built-in models for the semiconductor devices, and the user need specify
            only the pertinent model parameter values.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ngspice supports mixed-level simulation and provides a direct link between technology
            parameters and circuit performance. A mixed-level circuit and device simulator can
            provide greater simulation accuracy than a stand-alone circuit or device simulator by
            numerically modeling the critical devices in a circuit. Compact models can be used for
            all other devices. The mixed-level extensions to ngspice is CIDER, a mixed-level circuit
            and device simulator integrated into ngspice code. Ngspice supports mixed-signal
            simulation through the integration of XSPICE code. XSPICE software, developed as an
            extension to Spice3C1 by GeorgiaTech, has been enhanced and ported to ngspice to provide
            `board` level and mixed-signal simulation.
        </p>
        <p>The XSPICE extension enables pure digital simulation as well.</p>
        <p>
            New devices can be added to ngspice by several means: behavioral B-, E- or G-sources,
            the XSPICE code-model interface for C-like device coding, and the ADMS interface based
            on Verilog-A and XML.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, numerous small bugs have been discovered and fixed, and the program has been
            ported to a wider variety of computing platforms.
        </p>
        <h2 id="1.1">1.1 Simulation Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
            Computer-based circuit simulation is often used as a tool by designers, test engineers,
            and others who want to analyze the operation of a design without examining the physical
            circuit. Simulation allows you to change quickly the parameters of many of the circuit
            elements to determine how they affect the circuit response. Often it is difficult or
            impossible to change these parameters in a physical circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, to be practical, a simulator must execute in a reasonable amount of time. The
            key to efficient execution is choosing the proper level of modeling abstraction for a
            given problem. To support a given modeling abstraction, the simulator must provide
            appropriate algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Historically, circuit simulators have supported either an analog simulation algorithm or
            a digital simulation algorithm. Ngspice inherits the XSPICE framework and supports both
            analog and digital algorithms and is a `mixed-mode` simulator.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.1.1">1.1.1 Analog Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            Analog simulation focuses on the linear and non-linear behavior of a circuit over a
            continuous time or frequency interval. The circuit response is obtained by iteratively
            solving Kirchhoff's Laws for the circuit at time steps selected to ensure the solution
            has converged to a stable value and that numerical approximations of integrations are
            sufficiently accurate. Since Kirchhoff's laws form a set of simultaneous equations, the
            simulator operates by solving a matrix of equations at each time point. This matrix
            processing generally results in slower simulation times when compared to digital circuit
            simulators.
        </p>
        <p>
            The response of a circuit is a function of the applied sources. Ngspice offers a variety
            of source types including DC, sine-wave, and pulse. In addition to specifying sources,
            the user must define the type of simulation to be run. This is termed the `mode of
            analysis`. Analysis modes include DC analysis, AC analysis, and transient analysis. For
            DC analysis, the time-varying behavior of reactive elements is neglected and the
            simulator calculates the DC solution of the circuit. Swept DC analysis may also be
            accomplished with ngspice. This is simply the repeated application of DC analysis over a
            range of DC levels for the input sources. For AC analysis, the simulator determines the
            response of the circuit, including reactive elements to small-signal sinusoidal inputs
            over a range of frequencies. The simulator output in this case includes amplitudes and
            phases as a function of frequency. For transient analysis, the circuit response,
            including reactive elements, is analyzed to calculate the behavior of the circuit as a
            function of time.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.1.2">1.1.2 Device Models for Analog Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            There are three models for bipolar junction transistors, all based on the
            integral-charge model of Gummel and Poon; however, if the Gummel-Poon parameters are not
            specified, the basic model (BJT) reduces to the simpler Ebers-Moll model. In either case
            and in either models, charge storage effects, ohmic resistances, and a current-dependent
            output conductance may be included. The second bipolar model BJT2 adds dc current
            computation in the substrate diode. The third model (VBIC) contains further enhancements
            for advanced bipolar devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The semiconductor diode model can be used for either junction diodes or Schottky barrier
            diodes. There are two models for JFET: the first (JFET) is based on the model of
            Shichman and Hodges, the second (JFET2) is based on the Parker-Skellern model. All the
            original six MOSFET models are implemented: MOS1 is described by a square-law I-V
            characteristic, MOS2 [1] is an analytical model, while MOS3 [1] is a semi-empirical
            model; MOS6 [2] is a simple analytic model accurate in the short channel region; MOS9,
            is a slightly modified Level 3 MOSFET model - not to confuse with Philips level 9; BSIM
            1 [3, 4]; BSIM2 [5] are the old BSIM (Berkeley Short-channel IGFET Model) models. MOS2,
            MOS3, and BSIM include second-order effects such as channel-length modulation,
            subthreshold conduction, scattering-limited velocity saturation, small-size effects, and
            charge controlled capacitances. The recent MOS models for submicron devices are the
            BSIM3 (<a href="http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsim/?page=BSIM3"
                >Berkeley BSIM3 web page</a
            >) and BSIM4 (<a href="http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsim/?page=BSIM4"
                >Berkeley BSIM4 web page</a
            >) models. Silicon-on-insulator MOS transistors are described by the SOI models from the
            BSIMSOI family (<a href="http://www-device.eecs.berkeley.edu/bsim/?page=BSIMSOI"
                >Berkeley BSIMSOI web page</a
            >) and the STAG [18] one. There is partial support for a couple of HFET models and one
            model for MESA devices.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.1.3">1.1.3 Digital Simulation Digital circuit simulation</h3>
        <p>
            differs from analog circuit simulation in several respects. A primary difference is that
            a solution of Kirchhoff's laws is not required. Instead, the simulator must only
            determine whether a change in the logic state of a node has occurred and propagate this
            change to connected elements. Such a change is called an `event`.
        </p>
        <p>
            When an event occurs, the simulator examines only those circuit elements that are
            affected by the event. As a result, matrix analysis is not required in digital
            simulators. By comparison, analog simulators must iteratively solve for the behavior of
            the entire circuit because of the forward and reverse transmission properties of analog
            components. This difference results in a considerable computational advantage for
            digital circuit simulators, which is reflected in the significantly greater speed of
            digital simulations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.1.4">1.1.4 Mixed-Signal Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            Modern circuits often contain a mix of analog and digital circuits. To simulate such
            circuits efficiently and accurately a mix of analog and digital simulation techniques is
            required. When analog simulation algorithms are combined with digital simulation
            algorithms, the result is termed `mixed-mode simulation`.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two basic methods of implementing mixed-mode simulation used in practice are the `native
            mode` and `glued mode` approaches. Native mode simulators implement both an analog
            algorithm and a digital algorithm in the same executable. Glued mode simulators actually
            use two simulators, one of which is analog and the other digital. This type of simulator
            must define an input/output protocol so that the two executables can communicate with
            each other effectively. The communication constraints tend to reduce the speed, and
            sometimes the accuracy, of the complete simulator. On the other hand, the use of a glued
            mode simulator allows the component models developed for the separate executables to be
            used without modification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ngspice is a native mode simulator providing both analog and event-based simulation in
            the same executable. The underlying algorithms of ngspice (coming from XSPICE and its
            Code Model Subsystem) allow use of all the standard SPICE models, provide a pre-defined
            collection of the most common analog and digital functions, and provide an extensible
            base on which to build additional models.
        </p>
        <h4 id="1.1.4.1">1.1.4.1 User-Defined Nodes</h4>
        <p>
            Ngspice supports creation of `User-Defined Node` types. User-Defined Node types allow
            you to specify nodes that propagate data other than voltages, currents, and digital
            states. Like digital nodes, User-Defined Nodes use event-driven simulation, but the
            state value may be an arbitrary data type. A simple example application of User-Defined
            Nodes is the simulation of a digital signal processing filter algorithm. In this
            application, each node could assume a real or integer value. More complex applications
            may define types that involve complex data such as digital data vectors or even
            non-electronic data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ngspice digital simulation is actually implemented as a special case of this
            User-Defined Node capability where the digital state is defined by a data structure that
            holds a Boolean logic state and a strength value.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.1.5">1.1.5 Mixed-Level Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            Ngspice can simulate numerical device models for diodes and transistors in two different
            ways, either through the integrated DSIM simulator or interfacing to GSS TCAD system.
            DSIM is an internal C-based device simulator that is part of the CIDER simulator, the
            mixed-level simulator based on SPICE3f5. CIDER within ngspice provides circuit analyses,
            compact models for semiconductor devices, and one- or two-dimensional numerical device
            models.
        </p>
        <h4 id="1.1.5.1">1.1.5.1 CIDER (DSIM)</h4>
        <p>
            CIDER integrates the DSIM simulator with Spice3. It provides accurate, one- and
            twodimensional numerical device models based on the solution of Poisson's equation, and
            the electron and hole current-continuity equations. DSIM incorporates many of the same
            basic physical models found in the Stanford two-dimensional device simulator PISCES.
            Input to CIDER consists of a SPICE-like description of the circuit and its compact
            models, and PISCES-like descriptions of the structures of numerically modeled devices.
            As a result, CIDER should seem familiar to designers already accustomed to these two
            tools. The CIDER input format has great flexibility and allows access to physical model
            parameters. New physical models have been added to allow simulation of state-of-the-art
            devices. These include transverse field mobility degradation important in scaled-down
            MOSFETs and a polysilicon model for poly-emitter bipolar transistors. Temperature
            dependence has been included over the range from -50C to 150C. The numerical models can
            be used to simulate all the basic types of semiconductor devices: resistors, MOS
            capacitors, diodes, BJTs, JFETs and MOSFETs. BJTs and JFETs can be modeled with or
            without a substrate contact. Support has been added for the management of device
            internal states.
        </p>
        <h4 id="1.1.5.2">1.1.5.2 GSS TCAD</h4>
        <p>
            GSS is a TCAD software that enables two-dimensional numerical simulation of
            semiconductor device with well-known drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic method. GSS has
            Basic DDM (drift-diffusion method) solver, Lattice Temperature Corrected DDM solver, EBM
            (energy balance method) solver and Quantum corrected DDM solver based on densitygradient
            theory. The GSS program is directed via input statements by a user specified disk file.
            Supports triangle mesh generation and adaptive mesh refinement. Employs PMI (physical
            model interface) to support various materials, including compound semiconductor
            materials such as SiGe and AlGaAs. Supports DC sweep, transient and AC sweep
            calculations. The device can be stimulated by voltage or current source(s).
        </p>
        <p>
            GSS is no longer updated, but is still available as open source as a limited edition of
            the commercial GENIUS TCAD tool. This interface has not been tested with actual ngspice
            versions and may need some maintenance efforts.
        </p>
        <h2 id="1.2">1.2 Supported Analyses</h2>
        <p>The ngspice simulator supports the following different types of analysis:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>DC Analysis (Operating Point and DC Sweep)</li>
            <li>AC Small-Signal Analysis</li>
            <li>Transient Analysis</li>
            <li>Pole-Zero Analysis</li>
            <li>Small-Signal Distortion Analysis</li>
            <li>Sensitivity Analysis</li>
            <li>Noise Analysis</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Applications that are exclusively analog can make use of all analysis modes with the
            exception of Code Model subsystem that do not implements Pole-Zero, Distortion,
            Sensitivity and Noise analyses. Event-driven applications that include digital and
            User-Defined Node types may make use of DC (operating point and DC sweep) and Transient
            only.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to understand the relationship between the different analyses and the two
            underlying simulation algorithms of ngspice, it is important to understand what is meant
            by each analysis type. This is detailed below.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2.1">1.2.1 DC Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            The DC analysis portion of ngspice determines the dc operating point of the circuit with
            inductors shorted and capacitors opened. DC analysis options are specified on the .DC,
            .TF, and .OP control lines.
        </p>
        <p>
            DC analysis does not consider any time dependence on any of the sources within the
            system description. The simulator algorithm subdivides the circuit into those portions
            that require the analog simulator algorithm and those that require the event-driven
            algorithm. Each subsystem block is then iterated to solution, with the interfaces
            between analog nodes and event-driven nodes iterated for consistency across the entire
            system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once stable values are obtained for all nodes in the system, the analysis halts and the
            results may be displayed or printed out as you request them.
        </p>
        <p>
            A dc analysis is automatically performed prior to a transient analysis to determine the
            transient initial conditions, and prior to an ac small-signal analysis to determine the
            linearized, small-signal models for nonlinear devices. If requested, the DC small-signal
            value of a transfer function (ratio of output variable to input source), input
            resistance, and output resistance is also computed as a part of the DC solution. DC
            analysis can also be used to generate DC transfer curves: a specified independent
            voltage, current source, resistor or temperature is stepped over a user-specified range
            and the DC output variables are stored for each sequential source value.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2.2">1.2.2 AC Small-Signal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            AC analysis is limited to analog nodes and represents the small signal, sinusoidal
            solution of the analog system described at a particular frequency or set of frequencies.
            This analysis is similar to the DC analysis in that it represents the steady-state
            behavior of the described system with a single input node
            <em>at a given set of stimulus frequencies.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The program first computes the dc operating point of the circuit and determines
            linearized, small-signal models for all of the nonlinear devices in the circuit. The
            resultant linear circuit is then analyzed over a user-specified range of frequencies.
            The desired output of an ac small-signal analysis is usually a transfer function
            (voltage gain, transimpedance, etc). If the circuit has only one ac input, it is
            convenient to set that input to unity and zero phase, so that output variables have the
            same value as the transfer function of the output variable with respect to the input.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2.3">1.2.3 Transient Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Transient analysis is an extension of DC analysis to the time domain. A transient
            analysis first obtains a DC solution to provide a point of departure for simulating
            time-varying behavior. Once the DC solution is obtained, the time-dependent aspects of
            the system are reintroduced, and the two simulator algorithms incrementally solve for
            the time varying behavior of the entire system. Inconsistencies in node values are
            resolved by the two simulation algorithms such that the time-dependent waveforms created
            by the analysis are consistent across the entire simulated time interval. Resulting
            time-varying descriptions of node behavior for the specified time interval are
            accessible to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            All sources that are not time dependent (for example, power supplies) are set to their
            dc value. The transient time interval is specified on a `.TRAN` control line.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2.4">1.2.4 Pole-Zero Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Pole-zero analysis in ngspice computes the poles and/or zeros in the small-signal ac
            transfer function. Ngspice first computes the dc operating point and then determines the
            linearized, small-signal models for all the nonlinear devices in the circuit. The
            small-signal circuit model is then used to find the poles and zeros of the transfer
            function. Two types of transfer functions are allowed: one of the form (output
            voltage)/(input voltage) and the other of the form (output voltage)/(input current).
            These two types of transfer functions cover all the cases and one can find the
            poles/zeros of functions like input/output impedance and voltage gain. The input and
            output ports are specified as two pairs of nodes. The pole-zero analysis works with
            resistors, capacitors, inductors, linear-controlled sources, independent sources, BJTs,
            MOSFETs, JFETs and diodes. Transmission lines are not supported.
        </p>
        <p>
            The method used in the analysis is a sub-optimal numerical search. For large circuits it
            may take a considerable time or fail to find all poles and zeros. Please note, that for
            some circuits, the method becomes “lost” and may find an excessive number of poles or
            zeros.

        <h3 id="1.2.5">1.2.5 Small-Signal Distortion Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Distortion analysis in ngspice computes steady-state harmonic and intermodulation
            products for small input signal magnitudes. If signals of a single frequency are
            specified as the input to the circuit, the complex values of the second and third
            harmonics are determined at every point in the circuit. If there are signals of two
            frequencies input to the circuit, the analysis finds out the complex values of the
            circuit variables at the sum and difference of the input frequencies, and at the
            difference of the smaller frequency from the second harmonic of the larger frequency.
            Distortion analysis is supported for the following nonlinear devices:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Diodes (DIO),</li>
            <li>BJT,</li>
            <li>JFET (level 1),</li>
            <li>MOSFETs (levels 1, 2, 3, 9, and BSIM1),</li>
            <li>MESFET (level 1).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            All linear devices are automatically supported by distortion analysis. If there are
            switches present in the circuit, the analysis continues to be accurate provided the
            switches do not change state under the small excitations used for distortion
            calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a device model does not support direct small signal distortion analysis, please use
            the Fourier of FFT statements and evaluate the output per scripting.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2.6">1.2.6 Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Ngspice can calculate either the DC operating-point sensitivity or the AC small-signal
            sensitivity of an output variable with respect to all circuit variables, including model
            parameters. Ngspice calculates the difference in an output variable (either a node
            voltage or a branch current) by perturbing each parameter of each device independently.
            Since the method is a numerical approximation, the results may demonstrate second order
            effects in highly sensitive parameters, or may fail to show very low but non-zero
            sensitivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since each variable is perturbed by a small fraction of its value, zero-valued
            parameters are not analyzed, reducing what is usually a very large amount of data.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1.2.7">1.2.7 Noise Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Noise analysis in ngspice measures the device-generated noise for a given circuit. When
            provided with an input source and an output port, the analysis calculates the noise
            contributions of each device, and each noise generator within each device, as measured
            as a voltage at the output port. Noise analysis also calculates the equivalent input
            noise of the circuit, based on the output noise. This is done for every frequency point
            in a specified range - the calculated value of the noise corresponds to the spectral
            density of the circuit variable viewed as a stationary Gaussian stochastic process.
            After calculating the spectral densities, noise analysis integrates these values over
            the specified frequency range to arrive at the total noise voltage and current over this
            frequency range. The calculated values correspond to the variance of the circuit
            variables viewed as stationary Gaussian processes.

        <h3 id="1.2.8">1.2.8 Periodic Steady State Analysis</h3>
        <p><em>Experimental code.</em></p>
        <p>
            PSS is a radio frequency periodical large-signal dedicated analysis. The implementation
            is based on a time domain shooting method that make use of transient analysis. As it is
            in early development stage, PSS performs analysis only on autonomous circuits, meaning
            that it is able to predict fundamental frequency and (harmonic) amplitude(s) for
            oscillators, VCOs, etc.. The algorithm is based on a search of the minimum error vector
            defined as the difference of RHS vectors between two occurrences of an estimated period.
            Convergence is reached when the mean of this error vector decreases below a given
            threshold parameter. Results of PSS are the basis of periodical large-signal analyses
            like PAC or PNoise. ## 1.3 Analysis at Different Temperatures
        </p>
        <h2 id="1.3">1.3 Analysis at Different Temperatures</h2>
        <h3 id="1.3.1">1.3.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Temperature, in ngspice, is a property associated to the entire circuit, rather than an
            analysis option. Circuit temperature has a default (nominal) value of 27°C (300.15 K)
            that can be changed using the <strong>TEMP</strong> option in an `.option` control line
            (see 15.1.1) or by the `.TEMP` line (see 2.12), which has precedence over the `.option
            TEMP` line. All analyses are, thus, performed at circuit temperature, and if you want to
            simulate circuit behavior at different temperatures you should prepare a netlist for
            each temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
            All input data for ngspice is assumed to have been measured at the circuit nominal
            temperature. This value can further be overridden for any device that models temperature
            effects by specifying the <strong>TNOM</strong> parameter on the `.model` itself.
            Individual instances may further override the circuit temperature through the
            specification of <strong>TEMP</strong> and <strong>DTEMP</strong> parameters on the
            instance. The two options are not independent even if you can specify both on the
            instance line, the <strong>TEMP</strong> option overrides <strong>DTEMP</strong>. The
            algorithm to compute instance temperature is described below:

        <hr />
        <p><strong>Algorithm 1.1</strong> Instance temperature computation</p>
        <pre>
IF TEMP is specified THEN 
instance_temperature = TEMP 
ELSE IF

END IF</pre
        >
        <p>
            Temperature dependent support is provided for all devices except voltage and current
            sources (either independent and controlled) and BSIM models. BSIM MOSFETs have an
            alternate temperature dependency scheme that adjusts all of the model parameters before
            input to ngspice.
        </p>
        <p>
            For details of the BSIM temperature adjustment, see [6] and [7]. Temperature appears
            explicitly in the exponential terms of the BJT and diode model equations. In addition,
            saturation currents have a built-in temperature dependence. The temperature dependence
            of the saturation current in the BJT models is determined by:
        </p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} I_S (T_1) = I_S (T_0) \left( \frac{T_1}{T_0} \right)^{XTI} {\rm exp}
        \left( \frac{E_g q (T_1 T_0)}{k (T_1 - T_0)} \right) \tag{1} \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electronic charge, $E_g$ is the energy gap
            model parameter, and $XTI$ is the saturation current temperature exponent (also a model
            parameter, and usually equal to 3).
        </p>
        <p>The temperature dependence of forward and reverse beta is according to the formula:</p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} B (T_1) = B (T_0) \left( \frac{T_1}{T_0} \right)^{XTB} \tag{2}
        \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            where $T_0$ and $T_1$ are in degrees Kelvin, and $XTB$ is a user-supplied model
            parameter. Temperature effects on beta are carried out by appropriate adjustment to the
            values of $B_F$ , $I_{SE}$, $B_R$, and $I_{SC}$ (SPICE model parameters BF, ISE, BR, and
            ISC, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
            Temperature dependence of the saturation current in the junction diode model is
            determined by:
        </p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} I_S (T_1) = I_S (T_0) \left( \frac{T_1}{T_0} \right)^{\frac{XTI}{N}} {\rm
        exp} \left( \frac{E_g q (T_1 T_0)}{Nk (T_1 - T_0)} \right) \tag{3} \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            where $N$ is the emission coefficient model parameter, and the other symbols have the
            same meaning as above. Note that for Schottky barrier diodes, the value of the
            saturation current temperature exponent, $XTI$, is usually 2. Temperature appears
            explicitly in the value of junction potential, U (in Ngspice PHI), for all the device
            models.
        </p>
        <p>The temperature dependence is determined by:</p>
        $$ \begin{aligned} U(T) = \frac{kT}{q} {\rm ln} \left( \frac{N_a N_d}{N_i (T)^2} \right)
        \tag{4} \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $q$ is the electronic charge, $N_a$ is the acceptor
            impurity density, $N_d$ is the donor impurity density, $N_i$ is the intrinsic carrier
            concentration, and $E_g$ is the energy gap. Temperature appears explicitly in the value
            of surface mobility, $M_0$ (or $U_0$), for the MOSFET model.
        </p>
        <p>The temperature dependence is determined by:</p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} M_0(T) = \frac{M_0 (T_0)}{\left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{1.5}} \tag{5}
        \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            The effects of temperature on resistors, capacitor and inductors is modeled by the
            formula:
        </p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} R(T) = R(T_0) \left[ 1+TC_1(T-T_0)+TC_2(T-T_0)^2 \right] \tag{6}
        \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            where $T$ is the circuit temperature, $T_0$ is the nominal temperature, and $TC_1$ and
            $TC_2$ are the first and second order temperature coefficients.
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.3.2">1.3.2 Controlling the temperature</h3>

        <p>The default temperature is set to 27 °C.</p>

        <pre> .temp 40 </pre>

        <p>will set the overall temperature to 40 °C (2.12). The command</p>

        <pre> .options temp=60 </pre>

        <p>
            will set the overall temperature to 60 °C (15.1.1). Both commands are equivalent,
            however `.temp` will override `.options temp`.
        </p>

        <p>
            The temperature of an individual device may be determined by the instance parameters
            `temp` or `dtemp`.
        </p>

        <pre> M1 d g s b MOSN temp=35 </pre>

        <p>will set the temperature of the specific MOS device to 35 °C.</p>

        <pre> M2 d g s b MOSN dtemp=20 </pre>

        <p>
            will set the temperature of device `M2` at a delta of 20° above the overall temperature.
            The temperatures thus set are static throughout the simulation. It is possible, however,
            to sweep the temperature by a command like
        </p>

        <pre> .dc temp 25 49 2 </pre>

        <p>
            starting at 25 °C, stopping at 49 °C with a step of 2° (see 15.3.2). The current overall
            temperature may be assessed by the variable `TEMPER`, which can be used as part of an
            equation in B sources (5.1.2) or behavioral E, G, R, L, C sources (e.g. 5.2). A typical
            example may look like
        </p>

        <pre> Bt1 1 2 V='5 + TEMPER*TEMPER' </pre>

        <p>
            The nominal temperature, a reference temperature where device model parameters have been
            measured, is called `tnom`.
        </p>

        <pre> .options tnom=25 </pre>

        <p>
            will set the nominal temperature for all devices to 25 °C (15.1.1). `Tnom` sometimes may
            be set as a model parameter in a `.model` line (3.2.2), depending on the specific class
            of devices and its model parameter set.
        </p>

        <h2 id="1.4">1.4 Convergence</h2>
        <p>
            Ngspice uses the Newton-Raphson algorithm to solve nonlinear equations arising from
            circuit description. The NR algorithm is interactive and terminates when both of the
            following conditions hold:
        </p>
        1. The nonlinear branch currents converge to within a tolerance of 0.1% or 1 picoamp
        (1.0e-12 Amp), whichever is larger. 2. The node voltages converge to within a tolerance of
        0.1% or 1 microvolt (1.0e-6 Volt), whichever is larger.

        <h3 id="1.4.1">1.4.1 Voltage convergence criterion</h3>
        <p>
            The algorithm has reached convergence when the difference between the last iteration `k`
            and the current one `(k + 1)`
        </p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} \left| v^{(k+1)}_n - v^{(k)}_n \right| \leq {\rm RELTOL} \ v_{n_{max}} +
        {\rm VNTOL} \tag{7} \end{aligned} $$

        <p>where</p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} v_{n_{max}} = {\rm max} \left( \left| v^{(k+1)}_n \right|, \left|
        v^{(k)}_n \right| \right) \tag{8} \end{aligned} $$

        <p>
            The `RELTOL` (RELative TOLerance) parameter, which default value is $10^{-3}$, specifies
            how small the solution update must be, relative to the node voltage, to consider the
            solution to have converged. The `VNTOL` (absolute convergence) parameter, which has 1uV
            as default value, becomes important when node voltages have near zero values. The
            relative parameter alone, in such case, would need too strict tolerances, perhaps lower
            than computer round-off error, and thus convergence would never be achieved. `VNTOL`
            forces the algorithm to consider as converged any node whose solution update is lower
            than its value.
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 Current convergence criterion</h3>
        <p>
            Ngspice checks the convergence on the non-linear functions that describe the non-linear
            branches in circuit elements. In semiconductor devices the functions defines currents
            through the device and thus the name of the criterion. Ngspice computes the difference
            between the value of the nonlinear function computed for the last voltage and the linear
            approximation of the same current computed with the actual voltage
        </p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} \left| \widehat{i^{(k+1)}_{branch}} - i^{(k)}_{branch} \right| \leq {\rm
        RELTOL} \ i_{br_{max}} + {\rm ABSTOL} \tag{9} \end{aligned} $$

        <p>where</p>

        $$ \begin{aligned} i_{br_{max}} = {\rm max} \left( \widehat{i^{(k+1)}_{branch}},
        i^{(k)}_{branch} \right) \end{aligned} \tag{10} $$

        <p>
            In the two expressions above, the $\widehat{i_{branch}}$ indicates the linear
            approximation of the current.
        </p>

        <h3 id="1.4.3">1.4.3 Convergence failure</h3>
        <p>
            Although the algorithm used in ngspice has been found to be very reliable, in some cases
            it fails to converge to a solution. When this failure occurs, the program terminates the
            job. Failure to converge in dc analysis is usually due to an error in specifying circuit
            connections, element values, or model parameter values. Regenerative switching circuits
            or circuits with positive feedback probably will not converge in the dc analysis unless
            the `OFF` option is used for some of the devices in the feedback path, `.nodeset`
            control line is used to force the circuit to converge to the desired state.
